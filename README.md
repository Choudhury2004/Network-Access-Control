# Network-Access-Control
The Network Access Control (NAC) system is a cybersecurity project that automatically detects, authenticates, and manages devices attempting to access a secured network. It ensures that only trusted and compliant devices are allowed to connect, preventing unauthorized access and network threats.

This project integrates Machine Learning, Backend Automation, and an intuitive User Interface to simulate enterprise-level access control mechanisms.

ðŸš€ Features:
1. Automatic Device Detection â€“ Monitors network traffic and identifies new devices attempting to connect.
2. ML-Based Classification â€“ Uses a trained model to classify devices as trusted, guest, or unauthorized based on features such as MAC address patterns, IP behavior, and traffic volume.
3. Dynamic Database Update â€“ Backend automatically updates the database in real-time when a new device connects.
4. Admin Dashboard (UI) â€“ Displays live device status, connection logs, and access permissions.
5. Secure Access Policies â€“ Enforces customizable access rules for different device categories.

ðŸ§  Tech Stack:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
3. Database: MySQL / SQLite
4. Backend: Flask / FastAPI
5. Networking Tools: scapy
